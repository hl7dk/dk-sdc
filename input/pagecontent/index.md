## Scope and Usage


<p class="dragon"><strong>THESE ARE VERY EARLY DRAFTS</strong> THIS IS NOT AN AUTHORIZED PUBLICATION</p>



#### Open a Pull Request in GitHub

Pull requests are even better. If you are in a position to suggest how exactly your proposal should be implemented in the specification, do it! It helps the team maintaining the implementation guide a great deal.

#### Participate in IG Development and Maintenance

Please also consider joining the development effort. This is the best way to affect the outcome of the profiling work. You may even be compensated for your efforts. Please be in touch with HL7 Denmark to discuss options, if this even remotely interesting for you.

The best implementation guide is the one that reflects the views and the consensus of the whole FHIR community!

### Safety Considerations
This implementation guide defines data elements, resources, formats, and methods for exchanging healthcare data between different participants in the healthcare process. As such, clinical safety is a key concern. Additional guidance regarding safety for the specification’s many and various implementations is available at: [https://www.hl7.org/FHIR/safety.html](https://www.hl7.org/FHIR/safety.html).

Although the present specification does gives users the opportunity to observe data protection and data security regulations, its use does not guarantee compliance with these regulations. Effective compliance must be ensured by appropriate measures during implementation projects and in daily operations. The corresponding implementation measures are explained in the standard. 
In addition, the present specification can only influence compliance with the security regulations in the technical area of standardization. It cannot influence organizational and contractual matters.
